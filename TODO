New directions:
- understanding KIOPS and BAMPHI
  https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0377042722005714
- implement BAMPHI
- how to fix 'm' depending on solution (adaptive choice)
- predictor-corrector with expm-be
- higher order ODE methods
- grid adaptivity

- instead of setting R(u) = N(u) - Au how about
                     R(u) = N(u) - A^mu where A^m is the approximate matrix
                     constructed for the exponential integrator, i.e., the
                     matrix used to compute exp(A^m)

- Parabolic problems

- compressible flow problem

- general performance improvements, e.g., exp_multiply with tridiagonal matrix
- (semi) implicit methods?

-----------------------

Report:
- explain how the number of matrix vector multiplications with 'A' scale
  with m for the different problems - it seems not to be linear?
- do an experiment with an approximate Jacobian, i.e., take one of the
  PDE test cases (e.g. Allen-Cahn) and run similar experiments as you have shown for the
  FD code using the exact Jacobian and an approximate Jacobian.
- how do the graphs scale with h, i.e., the grid spacing?
  Your example is not the right one - when increasing N you should get a
  matrix which is worse conditioned
- explain issues with finite-element method, i.e., the mass matrix
